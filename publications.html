        <p><b>Abstract</b><br>
        <p>In this paper, we demonstrate three unique use cases of LiDAR data and processing, which can be implemented in an urban metropolis to determine the challenges that are associated with climate change. LiDAR data for the City of Toronto were collected in April 2015 with a density of 10 points/m2. We utilized both a digital terrain model and a bare earth digital elevation model in this work. The first case study estimated storm water, in which we compared flow accumulation values and catchment areas generated with a 20-m DEM and a 1-m LiDAR DEM. The finer resolution DEM demonstrated that the urban street features play a significant role in flow accumulation by directing flows. Urban catchment areas were found to occur on spatial scales that were smaller than the 20-m DEM cell size. For the second case study, the solar potential in the City of Toronto was calculated based on the slope and aspect of each land parcel. According to area, 56% of the city was found to have high solar potential, with 33% and 11% having medium and low solar potential. For the third case study, we calculated the building heights for 16,715 high-rise buildings in Toronto, which were combined with ambulance and fire emergency response times required to reach the base of the building. All buildings that had more than 17 stories were within a 5-min response time for both fire and ambulance services. Only 79% and 88% of these buildings were within a 3-min response time for ambulance and fire emergencies, respectively. LiDAR data provides a highly detailed record of the built urban environment and can provide support in the planning and assessment of climate change resilience activities.

        <p><b>Abstract</b><br>
        <p>Evidence suggests that the role of electric buses in public transit is important if we are to take steps to reduce climate change and the environmental impacts of fossil fuels. Several electric alternatives are currently operationalized, and the debate about which is most suitable is attracting considerable attention. This article provides a detailed review of various performance features for three categories of electric buses: hybrid, fuel cell, and battery. Economic, operational, energy, and environmental characteristics of each technology are reviewed in detail based on simulation models and operational data presented by various scholars in different contexts. The study develops a holistic assessment of electric buses based on side-by-side comparison of 16 features that best inform the decision making process. The review indicates that the selection process of electric technology is highly sensitive to operational context and energy profile. In addition, it highlights that hybrid buses will not provide a significant reduction in GHG and would be suitable only for short-term objectives as a stepping-stone towards full electrification of transit. Battery and fuel cell buses are arguably capable of satisfying the current operational requirements, yet initial investment remains a major barrier. Overnight battery electric bus is advocated as the most suitable alternative for bus transit contexts given the expected improvements in battery technology and the trend to utilise sustainable sources in electricity generation.

        <p><b>Abstract</b><br>
        <p>Qualitative GIS is a relatively new methodological approach for analyzing and visualizing qualitative data within a geographic context. Qualitative data can take many forms, including interviews, documents, photographs, and audio and video clips. Content analysis for example, is an effective qualitative method for analyzing text‐based data. We argue that basic concepts, (i.e. how to store data, data requirements, visualization techniques, and modes of analysis) within qualitative GIS have not been adequately defined, rendering difficult the replication of work performed and hindering the development of incremental knowledge in the field. Database management systems provide a means for storing, managing, and analyzing qualitative GIS data. A standardized and well‐designed open source database system provides a mechanism for qualitative GIS projects, ensuring consistency and project replication. Qualitative GIS data stored in a database allows for additional visualization options, such as geographic word clouds. To demonstrate the concepts we performed content analysis on Master Transportation Plans from Calgary and Montreal using SpatiaLite, an open source database system. We developed Structured Query Language (SQL) queries to generate and populate groups and theme tables within the SpatiaLite database. We present our database design and queries in the hopes that they will help others conducting qualitative GIS research.

      <div class="jArticle"><p>Garnett, R. and Stewart, R. (2015). Comparison of GPS units and mobile Apple GPS capabilities in an urban landscape. <i>Cartography and Geographic Information Science</i>, 45(1), 1-8.</p><br>
        <p><b>Abstract</b><br>
        <p>The research tests the accuracy of two consumer grade GPS devices and two GPS-enabled Apple i-devices within an urban landscape. Data collection is an integral component to many GIS mapping projects, specifically within a community-based GIS mapping project. Access to reliable and spatially accurate data is key to the success of GIS mapping projects that require data collection. The relative low cost and availability of consumer grade GPS units and Apple i-devices with GPS capabilities are abundant, making the devices very attractive to community-based mapping projects. The comparison of four receivers utilized 15 locations, occurring over an 8-week period. Overall results indicated that the Garmin 78sc GPS receiver provided the greatest relative accuracy within an urban landscape, with the four devices mean relative accuracy ranging from 3.65 metres to 6.50 metres. The Apple i-devices maintained a relative accuracy and reliability for the needs of community-based mapping approaches, such as those being used for urban stormwater management.

      <div class="jArticle"><p>Garnett, R. and Freeburn, J.T. (2014). Visual Acceptance of Library-Generated CityGML LOD3 Building Models. <i>Cartographica</i>, 49(4), 218-224.</p><br>
        <p><b>Abstract</b><br>
        <p>The acceptance of 3D building models is critical to all urban 3D visualization projects. Building models that are identified as unacceptable can increase the cost of the project, delay the delivery, and, in some cases, cancel the acceptance of the entire project. A 3D modelling approach of using representative textures and geometry rather than actual photorealistic textures and geometry was conducted to determine whether participants who frequent the building multiple times a week over a period of a year would be able to identify the visual difference. Three focus groups were established and used to evaluate the visual quality of the 3D building models. Participants were asked to rank the visual quality of the building, as well as identifying any geometry, texture, or overall visual quality problems. The participants from the three focus groups did not identify any texture or geometry mistakes present in the building models. The overall visual quality identified by the participants from the three focus groups was above average, suggesting that the 3D modelling approach is an effective means for modelling buildings with high visitation and significance.
